# Color Match Game
More than 2 in 1000 children are born with Cerebral Palsy. Many of them lack a viable way for everyday communication due to limited speech and limited fine motor skills to use regular keyboards. Those children may benefit from a touchscreen swipe keyboard that utilizes imprecise swipe motion to type. To test the hypothesis, I developed this browser-based game that simulates the actual typing task. Try the game [here](https://bishop-research-group-2019-spring.github.io/ColorMatch/). The game can be played on a touchscreen or by using a touchpad/mouse.

## Letters mode
Letters mode has four to six large letters located large keys with different colors. 

1. Adjust the number of keys on the top left corner.
2. Click the start button when ready. 
3. Try to touch (or move the cursor to) the key that matches the color and letter of the header. 

Once a correct match is made, you will earn one point, and the header will change color and letter. You will then try to make the next match. You can earn a maximum of 30 points, and there is no penalty for touching the wrong key.

## Spelling mode
Spelling mode has 26 letters arranged alphabetically on five large keys with different colors. In this mode, the header will not change instaneously when you select the correct key. Your finger/cursor need to remain in the key for a few seconds (selection time).

1. Adjust selection time on the top left corner. 
2. Click the start button when ready.
3. Try to touch (or move the cursor to) the key that contains the desired letter, marked by a black square in the header. As in letters mode, the header's background color also provides a cue. For example, if the header shows "HI" with 'H' marked by a black square, you will try to select the blue key, because the blue key contains the letter H.

Once a correct match is made, the header will mark the next letter or next word. You will then try to make the next match. You can earn a maximum of 34 points. There is no penalty for touching the wrong key.
